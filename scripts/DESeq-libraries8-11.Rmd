Rmd to go through `DESeq2` pipeline. Will check data. Then will perform some DEG analyses. 

Libraries 8-11 info: 
(These were used in the 02-DeSeq-Temperature.Rmd comparing elevated and decreased)     
They are all pooled samples:   
8 --> Day 2, infected, decreased temperature
9 --> Day 2, uninfected, decreased temperature
10 --> Day 2, infected, elevated temperature
11 --> Day 2, uninfected, elevated temperature

```{r}

Read in un-normalized counts:
