Rmd to get list of GO terms from each annotated list of genes in the 4 clusters of the heatmap. Heatmap is infection degs in Crabs C and E at time 2 and 17. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

### Crab C at day 2:
```{r}
crabC2_go <- read.delim("../analyses/crabC2_clustgenes_GO.tab", sep = '\t')
head(crabC2_go)
```

Print GO IDs:
```{r}
crab2_goIDS <- crabC2_go$gene_ontology_IDs
head(crab2_goIDS)
```

write out
```{r}
write.table(crab2_goIDS, "../analyses/crab2GOIDs.tab", sep = '\t', row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```
